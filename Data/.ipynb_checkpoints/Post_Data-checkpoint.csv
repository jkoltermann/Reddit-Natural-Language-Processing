# the deep space network

brian cox and robin ince visit canberra for the first of 4 special episodes recorded in australia. this week they visit the amazing canberra deep space communication centre where scientists communicate with, and track the 200 or so spacecraft that are currently exploring our vast solar system and even beyond. they are joined by astrophysicists mark cheung and alan duffy, nobel prize winner brian schmidt and comedian alice fraser as they track legendary space craft like voyager, still sending back messages from deep in space some 40 plus years after it first launched. they discover how despite these incredible missions we still don't know what 97% of our universe is made of, and how so many of these explorations are vital to our understanding of one very important planet - our own.",161,1084

space expands by approximately 68-74km/s for every megaparcec (average 71). speed of light is 299792km/s. a megaparcec is 3,26 light years. 

according to my calculation this means that the expansion of space exceeds the speed of light at:

3,26*(299792/71) = 13 765 million light years.

this is where it really messes with me since at about 71km/s it almost exactly corresponds to the age of universe itself. how come this calculation gives a value so close to the age of the universe itself?",148,871

68,1,"starlink and starshipi asked a few qs in different threads about starship enabling starlink to offer more sat payloads.

however, does anyone actually know if this was... you know apart of the plan? 

i guess, the plan was that if there's a moonbase spacex will not only ship the astronauts to the moon for some money but also offer them internet service so that they can do experiments and also use ai-enabled devices on the moon? for example, i've seen videos of 3d printers for buildings that can turn moonrock into building material (this is better than shipping everything from earth). 

anyway, was this part of the plan? 

for me, starlink is great... but 90% of the world lives in areas where they're actively putting in huge amounts of money for 5g connections. like africa, for example, has skipped a whole bunch of infrastructure issues and went straight to mobile. also, i doubt 90% of the continent of africa could even afford 100 usd monthly starlink.

i guess the other point is that starlink gets a lot better once starship can deliver more leo sats. i heard numbers ranging from 3x to 10x better... any sources on this?

even things as simple as food safety have massive consequences when you're far away from the nearest hospital and you need to be alert. as nasa began planning for their apollo missions, they worked with pillsbury to develop [hazard analysis and critical control points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hazard_analysis_and_critical_control_points), a production monitoring process to ensure food is safe at every point.

it has since been adopted by a variety of food companies to ensure each stage is safe and if not quickly correct it rather than react to it.

i recently learned about this on [stuff you missed in history class](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/stuff-you-missed-in-history-cl-21124503/episode/the-astronaut-origins-of-food-safety-105540766/). having safer food is something we take for granted, and outbreaks are quickly identified. it all goes back to having a reason to set high standards and creating processes to meet them. even if you don't go to space, you still have benefitted.

118,1,"hypothesis for the birth of universesthe universe is like a matryoska doll, universes exist inside of other universes. each universe has a finite amount of energy. however you can increase the potential of energy by changing the ground state. 

think of it like a ball. you hold the ball at 5ft, the ball has 5ft of potential kinetic energy. now imagine you can't raise the ball any further, so you are stuck at 5ft right? wrong, you can lower the ground. dig a hole in the ground and now you can increase the potential without raising the ball. you can do something similar with electricity.

so imagine inside a black hole it stretches timespace so much that it locally changes the ground state enough that the relatively small amount of energy trapped inside increases potential high enough to create a new universe. 

this new universe's time and space are completely disconnected from our own. even though this new universe exists in only a small portion of our space, it could contain a space as large or larger than our own universe. time is similarly disconnected, a second in our universe could be billions of years in the new universe.

this might also explain the fermi paradox. if a civilization advances far enough that it can digitize its consciousness, it might choose to live virtually. they might then create a universe to exist in. this new universe would act like the most powerful computer that ever existed because it would have access to almost limitless energy.",253,1484

what's really cool here is that the angular separation of the planets is likely great enough for direct imaging to be possible with the andes instrument found on elt, despite the fact they don't seem to transit. and this means we could get atmospheric readings net 2027 when the telescope comes online.

the planets themselves orbit a dim red dwarf \~15.8 ly away, and both planets are roughly earth-massed. the innermost planet orbits every \~10.3 days, and is about 8% more massive, recieving about \~67% as much light as earth, while the outermost planet orbits every \~21.2 days, and is 36% more massive, recieving about \~25% as much light.

actual habitability is unknown for these planets, but with so many planets being found around red dwarfs, particularly in the habitable zone, it's worth keeping a close eye out to study these systems. 

as shared in this group yesterday, the teams working with jwst on trappist-1 are gathering their data, and will have the earliest datasets (i believe) of earth massed planets around red dwarfs, and whether or not they have atmospheres. if they do, it could be hopeful news of other red dwarf worlds having the same.",212,1521

244,1,"how is the human body connected to the universe?as a perpetual learner, there is something fascinating to me that i feel like no one really talks about, and it is the connection between us humans, every individual on this beautiful planet of ours, with the universe as a whole.
my point is to make this information much more available and perhaps get more people interested in something that we take, in my opinion, for granted.
i would love to share this article i wrote, with everyone out there.

as a former combat medic, i studied a lot about anatomy and the human body‚Äîan incredibly complex yet fascinating machine, it is made up of countless cells, tissues, and organs that work together to keep us alive and functioning. but did you know that our bodies are also intimately connected to the universe surrounding us? in many ways, the human body is a microcosm that reflects the larger macrocosm of the universe.

firstly, our bodies are made up of the same fundamental building blocks as everything else in the universe. the atoms that make up our bodies, such as carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, are the same atoms that make up the stars, planets, and galaxies. in other words, we are all literally made of stardust.

but it's not just the atoms that make up our bodies that are connected to the universe. we are also subject to the same physical laws that govern the rest of the universe. gravity, electromagnetism, and the weak and strong nuclear forces all play a crucial role in the functioning of our bodies. without these forces, our cells wouldn't be able to divide and grow, and our muscles wouldn't be able to contract and relax.

the connections between the human body and the universe go even deeper than the physical. 
our bodies are also influenced by the rhythms and cycles of the universe. just like the earth orbits the sun and the moon orbits the earth, our bodies have their own natural rhythms. like the circadian rhythm that helps us to sleep at night and stay awake during the day, and this rhythm is tied to the cycles of light and darkness created by the earth's rotation.

despite the scientific connections, many people believe that there is a spiritual connection between the two. this idea is reflected in many spiritual and religious traditions, which often teach us that the universe is a living, interconnected organism, and that we are all part of this organism.

in conclusion, the human body is not just an isolated machine, but is instead connected to the universe in countless ways. from the atoms that make up our bodies, to the physical laws that govern them, to the rhythms and cycles of the universe, our bodies are a reflection of the larger world around us. whether you view these connections from a scientific, spiritual, or philosophical perspective, they remind us of the incredible interconnectedness of all things, and the fundamental unity of the universe. so the next time you look in the mirror, remember that you're not just looking at yourself ‚Äì you're looking at the universe.",516,3033

 'rashid' was launched by the falcon-9 rocket of the american spacecraft manufacturer spacex.  it is headed for the japanese moon lander hakutu-r mission-1.  later, the vehicle will land on the lunar surface through the moon lander.

 so far, emirates' lunar rover has been successfully launched.  however, it is not known when it will land on the moon.  three out of four lunar missions conducted so far have failed.

 salem al mario, director general of the uae space agency, said that their mission will be successful only if rashid lands successfully.  he said, this is a unique launch.  so far everything has gone according to plan.  spacex is an amazing company.  all their work is good.  the arduous journey to the moon has begun.  we are confident about this.  hope all goes well.

in the 90s did it become cool to think the 1970s moon landings were faked?

if not i was under the impression that it was a cool thing to not believe in the moon landing.

if so was it youthful rebellion? by the 80s support for the moon landing was up to 80 percent from 50 percent during the 60s?

what if instead of entertaining the thought of fake moon landings young people in the 90s instead thought space travel was amazing and wanted american society to surpass that achievement?

what if celebrities choose to promote science?

2. can we go through the bubble surrounding our universe and does light bounce off of the bubble surrounding our universe? if it can't, can some of the light get trapped warping infinitely around the edge of the bubble? ( like how gravity warps light in a way )

3. if there is a black hole at the center of our universe, is it what causes the bubble and what would happen if something touched the bubble surrounding us?

4. does the bubble rotate/move and is there some kind of internal or external force that pushes it? also if it does what happens if two collide?

5. could it break and what would happen? also what happens if a black hole touches it?

6. could stars and other things form outside of a bubble and how would that effect them if they were to come into contact with one?

i know that a masters in stem from an accredited institute is the minimum requirement to apply with 2 years of professional related experience.

my vast research of computer science degrees has led me to believe abet isn't really a thing looked at with. b.s in computer science or masters even though some of them hold an abet accreditation.

i'm in a situation where i already have a bachelor's in information systems that is not abet and have a good opportunity to get a masters in computer science from a decent college.

is this not having an abet degree likely to bite me in the ass if i want to apply to be an astronaut like 10-15 years down the line?

506,1,"deep space travel for the poor and untraineddear reddit!

i am a 72-year-old geologist and an atheist. as a geologist, i know that climate has always been chaotic. as an atheist, i do not have much to look forward to once i am dead and cremated. hopefully, that can be changed. cremation results in ashes, flue gases, and light generated by converting the body‚Äòs thermal energy into electromagnetic energy.  while ashes are handled in various ways (including expensive trips into near space), nobody does anything with the light/the photons that belong to the deceased. i plan to collect this light, use it for pumping a solar-pumped laser and send it as a brilliant headstone into deep space. talk about eyeball-flattening acceleration on the occasion of your cremation‚Ä¶ and passing voyager 1 in less than 24 hours.

all that is needed are transparent windows in a containerized cremation furnace. some optical elements like fresnel lenses, a gain medium in the laser, which matches the wavelength of the burning body, and a laser head placed on a decent telescope mount to choose the segment of space or the star you like to travel to.

this already gives you an impressive laser show on the occasion of your funeral, which might get your grandchildren more interested in astronomy than astrology. also, that headstone does not need any upkeep once it is on its way. and contrary to the standard monument, there is lots of space for a multitude of information you can send by digitizing the beam. think of pics, text, sound, and art‚Äîeven nfts. if you happen to be a transhumanist, you might as well send your complete gene code and perhaps dream of seeding space before someone else manages to colonize mars.

i post this here to test the waters. very uncertain about proceeding and how to gather a group of interested people. this is only a new combination of established technologies to form a new funeral procedure aiming at space. i apologize should this be offensive to some. but this is space reddit, and i would love to hear from you.

to avoid legislative problems (i am from germany), the whole procedure could be performed easily on a small offshore platform. i believe the good people from ‚Äûcopenhagen suborbitals‚Äú plan something similar for their rocket.

623,1,"provided a warp drive or similar tech is invented, what prevents us from building a ship construction dock in space?i know we cannot travel light speed due to our current understanding of physics, however a warp drive has been proposed and theoretically is possible.  this would allow us to bend space and travel extremely fast.  fast enough to explore our galaxy. 

if we had this technology perhaps we could construct a dock in space (sortof like the construction docks on star trek) that would allow us to build within it a ship large enough to sustain thousands of occupants for an extended period of time.  

the benefits of having ships such as this are obvious, we could colonize other habitable planets and relocate some of earth's population to these planets, reducing the strain on earth and its resources.  it would be easy to fill such a vessel with occupants using reusable rockets such as those spacex is currently using and working on perfecting.  

even if we constructed these docks now in space, and the ships within them, with our current speed of space travel it would allow us to terraform and inhabit nearby planets a lot faster.  the terraforming would be made a lot easier due to the tech on board such ships and the ability to use lasers or similar tech to remotely from the ship alter the planet surface.  

anyway, thoughts?",240,1351

757,1,"how much would it cost to build and launch a solar sail probe?i think solar sail probes are an interesting idea. take a small lightweight probe with some cameras and sensors and attach it to a large solar sail which is then accelerated to close to 20% of the speed of light by lasers back on earth.

this seems like something that can already be built with the technology we have available to us and since the probes are small and lightweight it doesn‚Äôt seem too costly to get them into space. all you need then is a laser back on earth to accelerate it and send it on it‚Äôs way.

is it the laser that would be the costly part? if the laser doesn‚Äôt cost too much then i feel like this should be a priority to build and develop. we could send a probe as far as alpha centauri as well as quickly and cheaply send probes to other planets in our solar system.",164,854

the return of american human spaceflight through the crew dragon combined with all the astronaut soap operas on tv during 2020-2021 reignites a passion in me.

i remember hearing about the 10 billion dollar jwst and thought it should have been cancelled in favor of a replacement to the space shuttle then i learned about jwst's capabilities and ended up becoming fully supportive. if this is the closest we will get to the starship enterprise in my lifetime i'll be happy. i am excited to learn what the planets in other solar systems are like.

before watching ""good night oppy"" i didn't care about robotic mars exploration. 

i have also picked up lori garver's new book.

and i'll admit i wasn't too excited when i first saw ""crew dragon"" but now i am happy nasa is not paying for more rides to the iss. there is a seat exchange agreement though.

805,1,"possibility of a self exploding asteroid/planet or asteroid/planetary bombhow does it work?
1: the object has an outer layer with a higher sublimation point than the interior
2: something causes the temperature to heat up to above the sublimation point of the interior but below that of the exterior. this is most likely to be something pushing the object to a close orbit around the parent star, but can also be caused by chemical reactions (like in a rocket), collisions or simply the geothermal heat inside the object if it is large enough.
3: when the interior sublimates, it expands. but since the outer layer is still solid, the interior material cannot expand more. pressure builds up until the asteroid or planet explodes catastrophically (this may not destroy it depending on the circumstances. actually something similar happens on earth. underground water is heated until the pressure has built up to a point where it bursts out. this is a phreatomagmatic explosion, a type of volcanic eruption.)",163,1007

the most powerful observatory sent into space succeeds the hubble telescope, which is still operating, and began transmitting its first cosmic images in july.

&amp;#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/v601ypabeg4a1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9e4f6b7783712c2f3e265b9412659d117f94a5c4

&amp;#x200b;

""it essentially behaves better than expected in almost every area,"" said massimo stiavelli, head of the webb mission office at the space telescope science institute, in baltimore.

already scientists say the webb telescope, now orbiting the sun at a million miles (1.6 million kilometers) from earth, should last 20 years, twice its guaranteed lifetime.

""the instruments are more efficient, the optics are sharper and more stable. we have more fuel and we use less fuel,"" said stiavelli.

stability is vital for the clarity of the images.

""our requirement was similar to that of hubble, in terms of pointing accuracy. and we ended up being seven times better,"" the mission office chief added.

the public appetite for the discoveries has been fed by the coloring of the telescope's images.

light from the most distant galaxies has been stretched from the visible spectrum, viewable by the naked eye, to infrared‚Äîwhich webb is equipped to observe with unprecedented resolution.

this enables the telescope to detect the faintest glimmers from the distant universe at an unprecedented resolution, to see through the veil of dust that masks the emergence of stars in a nebula, and to analyze the atmosphere of exoplanets, which orbit stars outside our solar system.

1084,1,"nasa is testing a new robotic arm that really knows how to chill outwhen nasa returns to the moon with artemis, the agency and its partners will reach unexplored regions of the lunar surface around the south pole, where it can get much colder at night than even on frigid mars. such surface conditions would be challenging for current spacecraft, which rely on energy-consuming heaters to stay warm.

&amp;#x200b;

&amp;#x200b;

a technology demonstration being developed at nasa‚Äôs jet propulsion laboratory in southern california may offer a solution that would enable exploration during the dark of lunar night, a period that spans about 14 earth days. the project, which recently underwent testing at jpl, is called cold operable lunar deployable arm (coldarm). it combines several new technologies to create a robotic arm system that can function in temperatures as low as minus 280 degrees fahrenheit (minus 173 degrees celsius).

&amp;#x200b;

‚Äúgoing to the moon, we need to be able to operate during colder temperatures, particularly during the lunar night, without the use of heaters,‚Äù said project principal investigator ryan mccormick. ‚Äúcoldarm would let missions continue working and conducting science even in extreme cryogenic environments.‚Äù

&amp;#x200b;

to explain the project, mccormick recalls a scene from the 1991 movie ‚Äúterminator 2: judgment day‚Äù in which a hostile android made of liquid metal is stopped cold ‚Äì literally frozen solid ‚Äì by a giant spill of liquid nitrogen. ‚Äúthe bad guy can‚Äôt work in those temperatures, but coldarm could,‚Äù mccormick said.

while coldarm won‚Äôt be operating in liquid nitrogen, it could operate on a lander sent to a frozen ocean world like jupiter‚Äôs moon europa, where its lack of heated parts would have the added benefit of allowing the collection of volatile materials without significantly affecting the temperature of samples. it could free up some two hours of time and up to 30% of a mission daily‚Äôs energy budget that mars rovers like curiosity and perseverance spend warming up their robotic arms so their gears don‚Äôt stress and break in the cold.

the 6-foot-6-inch (2-meter) arm is equipped with two commercially available cameras for 3d mapping that have the same imaging sensor that is built into the 13-megapixel color camera used by nasa‚Äôs ingenuity mars helicopter ‚Äì one of several technologies coldarm is adapting from the little rotorcraft. a variety of attachments and small instruments could go on the end of the arm, including a 3d-printed titanium scoop for collecting samples from a celestial body‚Äôs surface. and, like the arm on nasa‚Äôs insight mars lander, coldarm could deploy instruments to the surface.

this past september, in a jpl test bed filled with the material to simulate lunar regolith (broken rock and dust on the moon), coldarm successfully completed experiments that assessed its ability to gather data on the properties of that regolith. now coldarm has been sent on to complete the same rigorous testing in spacelike conditions that every mission faces. it‚Äôs targeting a launch in the late 2020s.

&amp;#x200b;

# what makes coldarm work?

several key new technologies allow the coldarm system to function in extreme environments. first, the arm uses gears made of bulk metallic glass, a solid metallic material with a unique composition and structure that makes it tougher than ceramic and twice as strong as steel, with better elastic properties than either. these gears require no lubrication or heating to function in the cold.

because the arm‚Äôs cold motor controllers don‚Äôt need to be kept warm in an electronics box near the core of the spacecraft, they can be installed closer to the science instruments, requiring no insulation and less heavy cabling.

and a sensor embedded in coldarm‚Äôs ‚Äúwrist‚Äù gives the arm feedback, allowing it to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù what it‚Äôs doing in all directions, like a human jiggling a key into a keyhole and turning the lock. that device, called a six-axis force torque sensor, can also operate in extreme cold.

in addition to employing cameras designed for commercial use, coldarm leverages other technology that has been proven aboard ingenuity: a powerful processor akin to those used in consumer smartphones and open-source flight software, called f prime, that jpl developed. like the mars helicopter, coldarm could operate autonomously, performing tasks and collecting pictures and sensor data without real-time input from mission controllers back on earth.

motiv space systems, a partner on coldarm, developed the cold motor controllers and also built sections of the arm and assembled it from jpl-supplied parts at the company‚Äôs pasadena, california, facility.

the coldarm project is funded through the lunar surface innovation initiative and managed by the game changing development program in nasa‚Äôs space technology mission directorate. caltech in pasadena manages jpl for nasa.",760,5075

1136,1,"de facto, permanent halt of our space travel abilities to the point it is now?i know from experience that when a problem seems impossible it might be in fact impossible and the solution to what you're looking for is not the solution of that problem.

universe seems impossible to be explored and theories demonstrated with folding a paper and nailing with a pen seem to be closer to fantasy than an early assumption that might be proven correct with some future technology.

it's just too vast.

having made it to mars, which once seemed impossible doesn't mean that we can make it to really long distances and explore places that might have life.

discoveries on that part have halted for decades now, our travelling abilities in space, and most scientists secretly fantasize about jumping in to a black hole and coming out to a new world on the other side.

because there's nothing visible in today's science discoveries nor theories.

at the same, we're limiting our energy resources and production on purpose for environmental reasons. not just that, but there is a complete halt in investment in new technologies that is bases in oil, gas, nuclear power, since they are demonized by environmentalists who now control science's course decision making.

&amp;#x200b;

so, we currently lack realistic theories, and investments, while placing all kinds of obstacles that make any breakthrough chance very low.

1282,1,"a possible way to get an ssto?a couple years ago i made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/mpqnts/what_happened_to_spaceplanes/) asking why we don't hear much about single-stage-to-orbit spaceplanes anymore, compared to the 1990s when there were literally dozens being proposed. the answers all pretty much said the same thing-- if you're building a single-stage spaceplane, that means burning extra fuel to carry things like wings and landing gear that are useless in space. with that in mind, reusable multistage rockets are actually a lot more efficient than spaceplanes. 

that said, there is *one* way i can think of that might allow an ssto to work. it just requires ignoring a key part of the definition of an ssto. to elaborate, an ssto is generally defined as a spacecraft that leaves the ground under its own power and reaches orbit, all in one stage. the ssto concept i'm talking about here (which admittedly is not my own) does not leave the ground under its own power, so in that respect it doesn't meet the definition of one. 

what i'm talking about is a catapult launch. this would involve accelerating the spacecraft along a magnetic track, something like a gigantic railgun, until it is traveling at such a high speed it can be launched. sub-scale tests of this have already done, but in order to launch a single-stage spacecraft into orbit, the magnetic catapult would have to be enormous, possibly on the order of several miles long. however, once it was built, it could be easily re-used much more quickly than a conventional launch pad.",258,1572

1428,1,"has the lack of an inspiring and visionary space program during the 2010s had a negative impact on american society?back in 2013 i was just graduating from high school and being so excited to get out into the world for the first time. during the summer of 2013 a friend invited me over to their house to show me ""mass effect"" and i was amazed by what i saw. before that i was not into stuff like ""trek"", ""wars"", science, or space. it also gave me an exciting vision of what the future could be. i ended up picking up the trilogy at a local gamestop. i find out about neil degrasse tyson and went stargazing throughout the summer of 2013 after buying a telescope from a barnes &amp; noble.

sadly by the time i went into college that interest in space and science largely died out. i became obsessed with ""greek life"", vacations to disney world, and getting a cushy office job that would pay for nice vacations each year, a german made car, and a nice suburban house. i became obsessed with ""organic food"" because all the most socially powerful students shopped at whole foods. i looked up to ""frat bros"" as the people to aspire to.

fast forward to the quarantine of 2020 and i finally decide i want to take my life in a different direction. my interest in science, space, and sci fi comes roaring back due to a show on apple tv. now astronauts, scientists, and engineers are my aspirational role models. not to mention an american space program that has largely been revived in the past two years. i support gmos and even nuclear power now.

i look back at the 2010s with shame.

i don't care much about vapid material things anymore. i want to commit to a vision of the future.

i lament the state of american society. i lament the increase of crazy politics and conspiracies. i lament the powerful people giving in to their worst impulses.

i wish american society could have been more aspirational during the 2010s. achieve better healthcare, education, rebuild crumbling infrastructure, better controlling the profits of people like musk and bezos, and instituting a space program that would really get the young excited to work towards becoming their best selves.

i lament the increase of attitudes like this among the younger generation.

its sad that if we could (from earth) view life on a distant planet say, 100 million light years away, and that life was about as advanced as we are, even if you could travel 100 million light years, that life would not look the same and could quite possibly be completely gone.  unless you traveled instantly and then that life would be the same.

edit 1. thanks for clearing that up.  feel like i was exposed to propaganda


edit 2. the guy talking about taking two orbs and mimicking the orbit is right. if it didn't rotate you would see all sides of the moon. it seems you basically always see the exact side of the moon because it rotates at the same exact speed as earth... which honestly, seems even stranger in my head, but hey, the universe is more than any of us can comprehend. the laws of physics are bound to earth, and we don't know the laws of the universe yet, or at least i don't.

however, would the second law not apply to the universe on a cosmic scale as it would be considered an open system with an abundance of energy sources rather than closed one. structures like galaxies could be considered highly organised and yet they still persist as entropy is said to increase. would this interpretation then explain why we see life so 'late' in the universe on earth and also suggest that life will become more and more common as time goes on?",166,970

me and my girlfriend are fans of stargazing and wanted a telescope for a long time. we only focused on low-price ones, where the selection is not very big. now, with her birthday coming up, her parents offered to buy one for her. the budget suddenly got bigger, we are now looking for one up to around 1000 ‚Ç¨.

the selection is now quite bigger and we don't exactly know which telescope to choose. the specs, that we want it to include are mainly:

* portability (we would carry the telescope to different places, for example to some hills)
* software help (some kind of goto software, to help you locate space objects)
* the ability to observe planets, as well as deep sky objects (since we are beginners, we don't want to limit ourselves too much)
* astrophotography is optional (would be nice if possible, but the main reason we are buying one is sky observation)
* nature observation is not required
* we are from slovenia, europe

since our requirements are not too specific, the filtering on websites still returns many many telescopes, and we don't know which to choose. therefore, the help from experienced people is much appreciated.

we know, that a telescope for 1000 ‚Ç¨ is not required for beginners, but since money is not a problem, we would prefer for a gift to be an expensive, quality telescope that we could use for years to come (rather then some useless other stuff that they might buy instead, if we choose a cheaper one).

thanks in advance for anyone that will take their time and help us.",295,1704

are those rough numbers in the ballpark?  this article shows that some of the defense data collection takes a while to be shared but basically with motivation any event in the atmosphere of some minimum size is captured on multiple sensors.   what's the roughly minimum detectable size of event today, near future?  it seems that any event over a certain size in the past 10 years is captured and waiting to be analyzed already.  is that a reasonable assumption?",202,1126

let's say for example he had a telescope that could look all the way down to the planet and he could see them. would they be moving in super slow motion for 23 years? or would they be moving normal speed and hed just age 23 years cause like why not?

how does that work? time dilation is messing with my brain.  

why does time move slower closer to he speed of light? for example i move the speed of light around the earth for 1 week. people on earth age what? around 2 years? and i age a week?  what? let's say it's a full light year. do i only age 1 year? and everyone i knew on earth is old as hell or dead? why?",172,850

1729,1,"why counseling is the best option for overcoming anxiety?  debilitating signs of an anxiety condition include racing thoughts, restless nights, and unprovoked panic episodes. fortunately, anxiety is a disorder that is often curable. over half of all patients who see a **therapist for anxiety**, depression, or other mental health issues had a substantial improvement in their symptoms, according to a national institute of mental health research.

given the high probability of success, it is astonishing to see how many individuals continue to put off seeking treatment due to perceived stigma. while some people are scared of what treatment can involve, others are frightened of seeming ""weak"" or ""broken."" the fact is that therapy for anxiety and mental health has countless advantages, beginning with a markedly higher quality of life.

**what motivates people to seek therapy?**

in general, people go to a **mental health therapist** because they need support and are hurting in some manner. 

because everyone's challenges are unique, the specific causes vary from person to person, however some common themes include:

**loneliness:**

the human species is a sociable animal. your welfare, especially your mental health, can be badly impacted by feeling lonely and isolated. in addition, the symptoms of anxiety or depression could make you feel even more alone, creating a cycle of loneliness from which it can be hard to break free.

**uncontrolled thoughts:**

in many facets of your life, anxiety causes misery and discomfort due to excessive concern and swirling thoughts. when your anxious thoughts spiral out of control, it can be very difficult to function normally at work, keep up with your relationships, or take care of yourself.

**insomnia:**

anxiety and depression are only two of the many mental health diseases that have a connection to restlessness and sleep issues. additionally, many illnesses' symptoms are made worse by inadequate sleep, producing a vicious cycle.

**abuse of drugs:**

self-medication with drugs and alcohol is a common practice among people who experience mental health problems, and it may both disguise and exacerbate their pain.

**why is treatment effective?**

therapy is about working through your issues to discover practical, long-term answers, not about venting or offering a fast cure. 

a trustworthy course of therapy offers you, among other things:

**self-awareness:**

finding the source of your issues is a key element of treatment. you may begin to overcome the causes of your anxiety or depression and acquire an understanding of why things are the way they are by discovering and resolving long-standing difficulties.

**healthy routines:**

therapy for anxiety trains you to alter your destructive thinking patterns and swap them out with positive, helpful ones. you also learn how to develop new routines that promote healthy living.

**coping mechanisms:**

you'll need to learn a few coping mechanisms to deal with the stress and worry of daily life to deal with the beginning of symptoms or to stop them before they start. counseling for anxiety might help you find strategies that will work for you.

**what are some of the various forms of therapy for mental health?**

there is no one-size-fits-all approach to effective therapy. different techniques are needed for various circumstances. 

among the open treatment alternatives:

**psychotherapy:**

patients interact with therapists in either a one-on-one or group setting to address anxieties, develop objectives, and improve interpersonal connections.

**behavioral cognitive therapy:**

this approach, sometimes referred to as cbt, combines talk therapy and behavioral therapy to alter problematic thought patterns and create problem-solving techniques.

**medication:**

to help you regain stability, medicines may occasionally assist relieve the symptoms of sadness and anxiety. depending on what you and your therapist decide, taking medication might be a temporary fix or a permanent one.

**psychological consultation for anxiety disorders:**

although there are several varieties of anxiety disorders, research indicates that most are governed by comparable underlying mechanisms. people who struggle with anxiety disorders frequently experience emotional overload and respond negatively to unpleasant feelings and circumstances.

people frequently try to deal with these adverse emotions by avoiding things that make them nervous. sadly, avoiding situations might have the opposite effect and make anxiety worse.

psychologists are skilled in identifying patients' anxiety problems and recommending better, more productive coping mechanisms. patients are specifically urged to approach anxiety-provoking activities and circumstances with the understanding that their feared consequences are improbable.",680,4842

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dindttcvo-4

i was amazed by what i saw. it was unlike any game i have seen.

after that i rushed to gamestop and managed to get a copy for $20 bucks.

i remember failing hard at first become i didn't know how to play rpgs. i was going into areas with higher level enemies than my character. it made a quit the game for a small time but i went back and was determined to learn how to play the game because i loved the characters, story, and universe i was introduced to.

i ended up picking up the rest of the trilogy and the dlc.

before that i was not interested in anything space or sci fi. i ended up searching for more experiences like that. i picked up some books of ""the expanse"". i also bought a telescope and went stargazing throughout the summer of 2014.

i find out that mass effect was influenced by shows like ""babylon 5"" and ""battlestar galactica"".

i wondered why there wasn't any shows with space travel in them. turns out i wasn't alone.

how would you reacted if back in 2014 a person told you they lamented there wasn't anything on tv with space travel in it?

what happened?

did the wars in the middle east and financial crisis of 2008 kill optimism for the future?

was it the retirement of the space shuttle and nothing big happening in the world of space exploration?

did we become too materialistic, as evidenced by the popularity of reality tv?

did society view things with lasers and aliens as childish?

were people too enchanted by ""superheroes"", ""game of thrones"", and zombies? loved got btw!

things are better now with loads of ""wars"" and ""trek"" shows but i think it would be awesome if something that wasn't set in those worlds become popular. i like ""for all mankind"" despite not being a family soap opera fan.",366,2307

i'm doing a hs 12th year ""research project"" done by all 12th graders in my country where you produce something akin to a ""research paper"". for my project i wanted to work with photometry and kepler data. however, i have ran into a bit of a conundrum in that what i have right now feels a bit too general.

&amp;#x200b;

what it currently involves is me doing noise reduction, processing and analyzing data on a system and then presenting the candidates i can find with estimates for their orbital period, and radii. 

i feel like this doesn't give me much to talk about in my discussion section due to the fact that my ""research question"" is basically ""what does this already collected data say about this system and its possible constituents if i process it?""

&amp;#x200b;

i've had someone suggest that i look at a planet-metallicity correlation but i feel like an issue there is that i would need a sample of hundreds of stars. if i'm to still have me doing the data processing be a significant part of the project then that doesn't seem very feasible.

&amp;#x200b;

would anyone  of you have any advice or know of something i could look at for my research question?

here's a couple of projects by former students i found online for reference:

1993,1,"tutorial: how ""detectable"" are near-earth objects (close asteroids and comets)hey everyone,

in my current *space science with python* project *near-earth objects* i set the goal to create a project that concludes with the following python-based toolkit: a widget or jupyter-notebook application, where one can set e.g., telescope parameters and settings (mirror size, reflection properties, ccd camera properties, exposure time etc.), atmospheric turbulences, the light pollutions of the sky and so on, to determine one's telescope ""detection rate"" of so-called near-earth objects (neos).

the python level is on a beginner / intermediate level, though the space science steps are small to give everyone the time and chance to digest all information.

in this video i start now to conclude the project. using all known neos, today's video provides a step-by-step guide how to compute the position and brightness of these objects and filter them out; based on set brightness properties (e.g., if a neo is brighter than this threshold it is flagged as ""detected"").

however telescope properties will follow soon. additionally, we need to take simulated neo populations into account. maybe, our known neo population is already biased by the way we discover these objects? possible bias discussions will be conducted based on known and simulated neos.

hope you like it! if you like to talk with me about astronomy and space related topics (and also machine learning), just write to me here, or on mastodon / twitter (links below). also, the github repository is provided at the end of this post.

ideas are always welcome! i plan to throw an off-topic video in between showing how to compute the trajectory of the jwst. maybe this is of interest?

best,

thomas

2001,1,"what is black hole information paradox?# the black hole information paradox is a puzzle that appears when the predictions of quantum mechanics and general relativity are combined. the theory of general relativity predicts the existence of black holes that are regions of spacetime from which nothing ‚Äî not even light ‚Äî can escape. in the 1970s, stephen hawking applied the rules of quantum mechanics to such systems and found that an isolated black hole would emit a form of radiation called hawking radiation. hawking also argued that the detailed form of the radiation would be independent of the initial state of the black hole and would depend only on its mass, electric charge and angular momentum. the information paradox appears when one considers a process in which a black hole is formed through a physical process and then evaporates away entirely through hawking radiation. hawking's calculation suggests that the final state of radiation would retain information only about the total mass, electric charge and angular momentum of the initial state. since many different states can have the same mass, charge and angular momentum this suggests that many initial physical states could evolve into the same final state. therefore, information about the details of the initial state would be permanently lost. however, this violates a core precept of both classical and quantum physics‚Äîthat, in principle, the state of a system at one point in time should determine its value at any other time. specifically, in quantum mechanics the state of the system is encoded by its wave function. the evolution of the wave function is determined by a unitary operator, and unitarity implies that the wave function at any instant of time can be used to determine the wave function either in the past or the future. it ¬†is now generally believed that information is preserved in black-hole evaporation.this means that the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct whereas hawking's original argument that relied on general relativity must be corrected. however, views differ as to how precisely hawking's calculation should be corrected.¬†in recent years, several extensions of the original paradox have been explored. taken together these puzzles about black hole evaporation have implications for how gravity and quantum mechanics must be combined, leading to the information paradox remaining an active field of research within¬†quantum gravity.g",384,2446

hi everyone,

in the middle of this year, i was offered a role developing space systems for the australian government. however, as it happened i lost this offer because of failing the final exam to one of my courses which turned out to be harder than i expected from the coursework and mid-semester tests (the offer requires all courses to be passed before i can start and australian universities have exam hurdles where exams need to be passed for the overall course to be passed).

to make matters worse, my gpa will be too low to apply for alternative engineering roles as my university does not remove fail grades from gpa calculations.

the only viable ways i can see myself going into the space industry is by going into the technician route for a few years then reapplying to engineering roles or by using my high school results to go into undergraduate law and then go into space law. which of these approaches is better and why?",190,1070

elon musk, the world's richest man, said that the ""starship"" developed by his space exploration technology corporation (spacex) was selected by the foreign national aeronautics and space administration (nasa) to be used by foreigners to return to the moon. the spacecraft will make its first orbital flight early next year.

&amp;#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/njq87mxk942a1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=204f2b5744de912370c18591dd833cd732c2b15b

musk said in a speech at the national academies space studies board (national academies space studies board) that they will conduct a series of tests in may, and it is expected to launch in may next year, but there are many risks in the first launch, and there is no guarantee of success. but definitely a lot of progress will be made.

starship has made several orbital flights, undergone multiple tests, and ended with an impressive explosion, but spacex has finally managed to land the reusable spacecraft.

musk added that it is expected to be authorized by the federal aviation administration (faa) around the end of the year. after the test launch in may, the goal is to conduct at least a dozen more launches by the end of 2022.

in the end, he revisited his vision and said that in order to find more planets with life, 1,000 spacecraft may be needed to perform the mission, and the ultimate goal is to make human beings a multi-planetary species and become a space civilization.

musk also noted that he wasn't sure starship would succeed in orbit on the first try, but expressed ""confidence"" that the rocket would be in space in 2022. ""we intend to achieve a high flight rate next year,"" musk said.

spacex aims to launch as many as 12 starship test flights next year to complete the ""test flight program"" and start launching ""real payloads"" in 2023, he said.

although spacex signed a $2.9 billion contract with nasa (foreign space agency) to develop the starship to send astronauts to the surface of the moon, musk said that the company ""does not undertake any international cooperation"", or provide external funding for rocket programs.

spacex has raised billions of dollars in funding over the past few years to fund starship and its satellite internet project, starlink, and the company's valuation recently hit $100 billion",364,2353

then i tried really focusing on the stars and adjust my eyes so that i can see those tiny stars that you cannot usually see. then, i saw these tiny dim stars at the corner of my eye all near at each other maybe 3-4 stars, they were very dim and tiny you almost can't see them. suddenly, one glowed so bright for half a mili second, it flashed so so fast and so bright, then the others followed, they were in sequence with mili seconds gap, then they disappeared. this went on for like 2 seconds. 
i was very intrigued and googled what just happened.

2096,1,"why mental health counseling is worth your time? although persons with mental diseases may be the only ones who may benefit from mental health therapy, this is untrue. therapy has advantages for everyone since it fosters a deeper understanding of oneself. an **individual therapist** also teaches clients how to manage their stress.

it's crucial to practice self-love, but like other abilities, it's a taught behavior. as a result, therapists and counselors can assist patients in leading happy lives.

for people who struggle with depression, anxiety, or alcohol and substance use disorders, loving oneself can be very helpful.

**benefits of mental health counseling:**

**it aids individuals in overcoming mental diseases like anxiety and depression:**

people frequently visit a doctor after breaking a bone because they are in agony. however, a lot of people disregard mental suffering, which may be just as painful. treatment is necessary for all illnesses, including mental ailments like sadness and anxiety.

negative consequences may result from untreated mental diseases. almost half of those with a drug use disorder also fit the bill for a mental condition. so rather than allowing emotional wounds to linger and worsen, it is preferable to seek counseling for mental health issues.

**counseling assists clients in developing unconditional self-love:**

the idea of self-love is the ability to value oneself and be satisfied no matter what occurs in one's life. it's simple for people to feel bad about themselves when they're going through a difficult or stressful moment in their lives.

people's mental states deteriorate when they think negatively about themselves more frequently. counseling may assist people in breaking out of their mental ruts and realizing that they are deserving of love and respect even when their current circumstances don't precisely match their expectations.

**it can raise someone's sense of self-worth:**

the polar opposite of self-doubt is self-efficacy. having a strong feeling of self-efficacy enables people to overcome challenges in their life. this is so because those who have self-efficacy have a strong sense of self-belief.

counselors and therapists can assist patients in seeing that they are capable of achieving their objectives and overcoming other challenges in their life. each therapist or counselor may approach this differently.

regardless of how they go about it, the social learning idea was perhaps first put out by renowned psychologist alfred bandura. in his essay on self-efficacy, he claims that encouragement and reducing one's stress reaction are two ways that one might increase this talent. a **mental health counselor** may also assist a patient with both, which can boost self-efficacy.

**people acquire stress management skills:**

stress management is essential to rehabilitation, whether a person is battling a mental illness or a drug use disease. through counseling, patients can pinpoint their stressors and learn how to handle them. additionally, therapy can assist clients in taking proactive steps to avoid being too stressed in the first place.

stress that isn't controlled can lead to undesirable outcomes. it may make it harder for someone to resist the lure of drugs and alcohol. it may also show up as strange bodily symptoms. people who are under persistent stress may have sporadic physical problems and illnesses more frequently.

**patients benefit from feeling validated by it:**

a competent counselor or medical expert can provide an opinion that can help someone feel better without feeling guilty. people can therefore cease holding themselves responsible for circumstances over which they have no control. in contrast, if a patient played a role in a terrible outcome, counselors and therapists can help them stop being so harsh on themselves.

after experiencing abuse or emotional trauma, people can blame themselves. domestic violence victims' spouses could believe that their actions called for punishment. a counselor or therapist can assist a patient in this situation in comprehending how disturbed and wounded they are as a result of their spouse's disrespect.

**any self-destructive behavior can be recognized by counselors and therapists:**

without realizing it, patients could take part in activities that are harmful to them. for instance, someone who may be depressed may understand that drinking heavily on the weekends makes their condition worse because alcohol is a depression.",665,4505

2126,1,"would it be possible for the milky way to absorb so many dwarf galaxies, enlarging it to a degree that is seemingly impossible, somehow dwarfing the likes of the andromeda?hello, i have recently learned of the phenomena of satellite galaxies, and how the milky way treats them. once i had read that our galaxy seems to absorb these galaxies, leaving little trace behind, and will eventually absorb all of the current satellites we now know, that the milky way had engulfed and consumed many galaxies in this manner throughout it's lifetime, i began to wonder if it would be possible for some sort of event to happen causing a galaxy to somehow break into pieces. almost like a galaxy becoming many dwarf galaxies, and these pieces somehow being pushed toward the milky way. the milky way would then consume the galaxies, increasing it's volume to exponential size, making it incredibly large. this would not be the only way for these galaxies to come to be, that is just the only theory i have thought of to cause such an uproar in the amount of dwarf galaxies that would take place. if this were to truly happen, could we then be enlarged to such a state, that we would dwarf the likes of andromeda? would we be able to then absorb it upon our time of collision? 

our answer is quite an obviously resounding yes. this could without a doubt happen, the only question i do have however, *is what would cause the initial increase in dwarf galaxies, and how would they then have their momentous trajectories coerced in the direction of the milky way?*  i take to the public to aid me, as i know not what could cause such a specific force. the stars must be somehow grouped in the ways they are pulled apart. or perhaps there could jest be an amalgamation of stars that all form into dwarf galaxies. if that was the case, in order for the rest of this theory to hold steadfast, that means there must be a stage that occurs during galaxy formation in which before the galaxy has fully formed, there are a myriad of dwarf galaxies that should soon come together. this is the only way i see fit, as for stars to randomly join together into a galaxy, they would defy the laws of probability. but even so, nothing would be stopping these stars from joining together. this process, would be incredibly specific, and require the utmost meticulousness to be carried out. with that i ask of you, what could these forces be, if this were to be a true event, and what could happen during these events that would seems to play a role in favor of this theory.

so i was reading about space travel. particularly ftl travel and i‚Äôve become a bit confused. i lost the picture i‚Äôm sorry. but i saw a diagram showing if a ship were to accelerate at a constant 1g they could reach vast distances in short time frames. such as andromeda within a few decades or even the edge of the observable universe within a century or so. 

my question is basically this. how can a ship traveling a light speed manage to cross millions, even billions of light years in a few decades. i always thought if a ship were able to travel at the speed of light it would the ship the same amount of time to travel as the light does. is time moving differently for the ship compare to people on earth or something?",149,819

2200,1,"has the lack of an big inspiring human spaceflight program during the 2010s have a negative impact on american society?i remember graduating high school in 2013 and during the summer of that year before my first year of college thanks to a friend showing me ""mass effect"" and discovering neil neil degrasse tyson i bought a telescope and went stargazing throughout that summer.

then by the time i reached college i became obsessed with ""greek life"" and vacations to disney world as well as getting a cushy office job that would pay for a big suburban house, a german made car, and nice vacations each year. i thought ""frat bros"" and ""sorority girls"" were the coolest people. i shopped at places like ""whole foods"" and ""trader joe's"" because that was where all the rich people shopped. i became convinced gmos were making america fat and sick. i even became an anti vaxxer for a really short while.

now fast forward to the quarantine of 2020 and i check out apple tv out of boredom as well as curiosity and one show on there reignites my interest in space travel and space exploration.

after finishing the first season of that show i binged watched anything astronaut themed i could find. ""first man"", ""hidden figures"", ""the martian"", ""interstellar"", ""apollo 13"", ""the right stuff"", etc.

i did not realize how interesting, dangerous, and inspiring real space exploration was.

i now think astronauts, scientists, and engineers are the coolest people ever.

after finding out some astronauts have blue collar backgrounds i do not look down on blue collar work anymore.

https://www.theverge.com/22822351/nasa-astronaut-candidates-spacex-doctor-drilling-engineer-navy-pilot

as i got passionate about space again i became interested in other areas of science too. i found out about ""nuclear fusion"". i become more supportive of nuclear power. i don't think gmos are harmful.

perhaps neil degrasse tyson was right when he said ""nasa is a force of nature like none other"".

why was the 2010s so narcissistic?

i lament the increase of attitudes and behaviors like this! https://nypost.com/2022/11/07/im-too-pretty-to-work-f-k-getting-up-at-6am-every-day/

https://www.wdrb.com/news/education/university-of-kentucky-president-promises-more-inclusivity-after-racist-attack/article_eddf588a-6a78-11ed-967c-77bc4cdf7ee0.html

what if instead of being inspired by vapid ""influencers"" america's young people were inspired by astronauts like victor glover and deniz burnham?

i lament the crumbling infrastructure and the disdain toward science.

cold war american society was more backwards on social issues but it achieved amazing technological advances. the interstate highway system, the moon landings, a rudimentary version of what would become the internet, vaccines, the space shuttle, the hubble space telescope, etc.

why has american society stopped dreaming and aspiring to be better people and building a bigger and grander society?

what if americans were not afraid to get their hands dirty?

and i lament the condition of russian society. once they had a copy of the space shuttle and a rocket called ""energia"".

now the russian people seem obsessed with amassing wealth and power for themselves while everything crumbles around them.

2450,1,"[project] data science tournament to determine spacecraft collision risk hey everyone,

i apologise in advance and this is not meant to be spam or anything but an exploration for those interested in helping mitigate space debris.

we're a small startup based in new zealand reaching out to all data scientists and space debris analysts who are interested in participating in a proof-of-concept data science tournament. the goal of the tournament is to determine spacecraft collision risk. there will be prizes for winners of the competition. and if you don't win, that's okay too because everyone participating in the tournament will get something special.

why are we doing this? we're trying a way to tackle the space debris problem and the ongoing crowding of orbits.

who can participate? anyone really. you can be a student interested in data science, a data science professional, a citizen scientist, a space debris analyst, a company, an agency, etc. there are no gates here except the curiosity of learning to do it.

do you need to know orbital mechanics? nope. all descriptive information will be provided prior &amp; during the tournament.

what's the purpose of the tournament? long term, to create reliable collision risk scores &amp; thresholds for possible collision events by crowd sourcing the data science as a way to tackle the blind men and the elephant problem in this domain.

where can you signup? [https://dora-tournaments.carrd.co/](https://dora-tournaments.carrd.co/)

please share this with your friends and colleagues who may be interested in participating in one of the most important data science tournaments for humanity.

if you're interested in what we're trying work on, you're welcome to check out at the links below:

ideally it would have the following features:
- sky search (or something similar) to look for planets and objects with software, so extensive training is not needed
- iphone connection abilities, whether that be for capturing photos, or controlling the scope
- excellent resolution, we‚Äôre talking able to see craters on the moon!!
- under $700

2620,1,"outer regions within galactic halo possibly more stable in regards to long-term habitability?hi, tried to find similar discussions or even articles, but so far haven't. which is why i would like to talk about a thought i had and maybe those who know more about this topic could chime in?

i've been thinking a lot about habitability lately, not just in the context of planetary habitability, but in regars to host systems and stellar neighbourhood.

afaik, within the galactic plane there are active and less active regions, the former possibly being very chaotic while the latter might be somewhat more calm. 

apart from lifecycle of stars, which ultimately determine the fate of the habitable zone long-term, there are also influences of nearby stars due to various extreme events, be it supernovae, gravitational disturbances due to close proximity, etc.

within the galactic halo, the massive spherical region enclosing the mostly ""flat"" galactic plane, there are dwarf galaxies, globular clusters as well as ""single"" star systems. here is a more up-to-date visualization what i'm talking about:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4thlbodc4si

with all that in mind, i've been wondering if those outer regions, far away from the galactic plane might be less hostile overall. there still would be the star's fate itself as the major threat to life in such a system - but all other threats seem minimal. wouldn't this impact habitability in a beneficial way long-term?

due to much lower star population, thus density of matter, there would be far less instances of interaction. this could ofc mean that there is not enough matter to form planets to begin with, or maybe certain essential parameters lacking to provide planetary habitability in the first place.

but if there is life out there, it may not experience the same existential threats due to absence of chaotic stellar neighbourhood?

being so far away, any civilization out there might never be able to reach the galactic plane or any other star system for that matter, though i don't know anything about how far these systems are apart from each other. but they also would be pretty undisturbed for as long as their star provides a habitable zone, as external mass extinction events may be less prevalent.

anyone have any thoughts on this?",365,2304

my question is, what are all the equations we need to get off the moon. 
by exemple, 

1.the equation of the time to get back to earth

2.the centripedal acceleration

3.orbital speed

4.liberation speed

5.revolution speed

6.frequency of the shuttle when in geostationary orbit

7. gravitational field of the moon to the first satelite in base altitude

8.the gravitational force between the spacecraft and the launcher when they are in a 100m distance

9. w needed to get the spacecraft to leave the gravitational attraction of the moon

10.approximate time to reach earth

2725,1,"how could a planet capture an object as its satellite?how can a planet hold an object that came from the place out of its sphere of influence? according to my derivation, an object can only escape the planet's gravity field but not stay,what's wrong in my calculation? this is my fully derivation process : 

now let's hypothesis we had dig a hole pass through entire earth and we throw a ball into it :

&amp;#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/ru7c97hp0o0a1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3eca7829a40211aaeeb9fb072cf08d719a0e131

 

now let's ignoring air drag,the ball will reach its max velocity at the center of the earth,and its velocity will slow down to zero when it reach the surface of the earth.this is because that after it passed the center of the earth,the earth's gravity is actually pulling it back to slow down it. at t‚ÇÄ or the time what it started to fall,it is 6,371 km away from the center of the earth,when it stops it's also 6,371 km away .it will also be the same if we release it at any height.

what if the object had an initial velocity towards the earth?

https://preview.redd.it/12r50ac15o0a1.png?width=1920&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7ecb47ef80f6bf3faef145c155d296be5cf488ac

 

it's a bit different,notice that it would fly up a little bit after it passed through the earth's surface.the initial velocity increases the total velocity to let the earth have to take more time to pull it down.

&amp;#x200b;

 

now the things go different, this time we release it at the edge of the sphere of influence of the earth.

&amp;#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/nn65vu9d9o0a1.png?width=1593&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9c5c4f8636f23404c7dd6ffdc4cdfe04b4b03916

it will stop at the other side of the sphere of influence of the earth,if it had an initial velocity towards the earth,it would just escape the gravity of the earth.and this will be the same if it comes from an even further place.

but if an object wants to enter the earth's sphere of influence,it must have an initial velocity,so no foreign object can stay in the soi of planets without decelerating.

2893,1,"could black holes explain accelerating expansion?i'll preface this post by saying i have nowhere near enough mathematical knowledge or even the knowlege of theoretical physics and relativity to actually support my hypothesis, but it's an interesting thought (to me).

firstly, we know that the universe's expansion, contrary to what the classic big bang theory would have proposed, is not slowing down - it's accelerating. that's observation is based on the fact far away galaxies are ""moving further"" from ours faster than the speed of light - something that matter shouldn't be able to accomplish. due to this, science infers that the space between galaxies is dillating, faster than any gravitational force can compensate for.

secondly, we know the only gravitational force capable of halting light is the force resulting from mass which has reached a critical density, resulting in a black hole. a region in space with such a density of matter - and therefore such a strong gravitational pull - that not even photons can escape its grasp once they cross it. black holes bend light around themselves, which leads to gravitational lensing.

thirdly, we also have the explanation of gravity actually being the interaction between mass and the fabric of space itself. like that esperiment where you put an object in the center of a stretched fabric, making a coin spin around it in orbits, which is the physical representation of how gravity interacts with matter. it bends space (which also explains gravitational lensing) and that's why mass ""attracts"" mass.

then, my hypothesis would be that black holes - more specifically the supermassive ones like the ones in the centers of galaxies - are absorbing matter and deforming space at such a rate that it could possibly explain why the relative distances between objects seem to be incresing so rapidly. black holes are regions in space where, for lack of better wording, things act weird. it's theorized that the gravitational forces past the event horizon could be strong enough to break matter down into fundamental particles.

to visualize what i'm thinking: if you're driving at a fixed speed away from a fixed point (point a), towards a fixed point (point b) the relative motion, and your position between the two points, correspond to the speed at which you're driving. now, if the road you're traveling on is stretching out behind and in front of you, even if you maintain the same speed, your relative distance from point a would increase much faster, and you would also appear to be moving much slower towards point b.

if gravity bends space, and a singularity is the most extreme expression of gravity, could this be behind the accelerating expansion of space?

nasa made the mistake of not having the sls painted white to resemble the saturn v. image is important. they also should have not night launched the first rocket because we saw 30 seconds. maybe it was cloudy but the apollo 17 launch at night was captured beautifully for 3 minutes. even if it had been perfect conditions, a day launch would showcase the launch vehicle better. i understand wanting to make this window given all the scrubs and delays but that was their fault to begin with.",203,1131

an individual born with artificial cells that decrease it's lifespan 26x would allow them to age 100 years on the new planet.

a 26√∑ a.c.h. would have a life expectancy of 3 earth years

imagine 10 million centauri people that live for 100 years on a planet having no idea that they live alongside earth people that live for 2600 years on the same planet, and earth people with artificial cells that would watch the planet grow for 22 thousand years.

imagine living on a planet 100 years after some aliens arrived after travelling 90 thousand years, nearly 1000 life times. then find out that you're actually a sub species they created for your planet that will live under them for 22 thousand years. then find out that they brought a small population of the species the aliens were before they modified themselves.

just think that 100% realistically in under 4000 years some guy that looks 50 years old will have outlived his entire lineage that he left behind at a dying planet over 24 trillion miles away. this man will watch hundreds of trillions of people die for 22 thousand years.

astronomers have recently made new discoveries. according to the research of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics, a new black hole with a volume about 10 times that of the sun and only 1,600 light-years away from the earth is found. the most recent one. but researchers say there must be even closer black holes that have yet to be discovered.

""harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics"" astrophysicist karim. el-badri's team discovered a new ""dormant black hole"" (dormant black hole) from the research data of the european space agency's ""gaia"" space telescope.

since light will be swallowed by black holes, scientists cannot directly observe it, but active black holes will swallow surrounding matter, and they will emit x-rays, so scientists can discover the existence of black holes. dormant black holes, which are not absorbing matter, are more common but harder to spot.

a statement from the national optical and infrared astronomy research laboratory (noirlab) said that a star in the constellation ophiuchus was moving in an unexpected way, and they realized that there was a gravitational pull from an unknown and massive object behind it. researchers have also used observations from other telescopes to support the theory that the mysterious object is actually a black hole.

at present, scientists have discovered about 20 black holes in the milky way, but it is estimated that there are more than 100 million black holes lurking in the milky way. karim. el-badri said that if there are so many black holes that have not yet been observed, then the newly discovered black hole cannot always be the ""closest to the earth"" black hole. he also believes that there may be many more nearby black holes.

the size of the star near this black hole is similar to that of the sun, and the distance between the two is also similar to the distance between the sun and the earth. the researchers are not sure why the star is not swallowed as its companion star expands, dies and forms a black hole. but it also allows researchers to discuss how more binary star systems form, as well as observe how many dormant black holes are still undiscovered here.",377,2442

3050,1,"nasa adjusts webb observing schedule to minimize threat of micrometeoroid impacts 

nasa scientists have worked for decades to design, build and launch the james webb space telescope, the largest and most advanced observatory ever built. nasa has some understanding of the dangers of operating a spacecraft in space, and built webb accordingly. one area of ‚Äã‚Äãparticular concern involves the inevitable collisions with micrometeoroids, tiny rocky or metallic particles that are common in space.

&amp;#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/zbig1syne80a1.png?width=2491&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d34927d4a002ecaf3a6e06e14b514c3c5c5e24f8

despite their small size, due to their extreme speed, they can cause a lot of damage when hitting a spacecraft. nasa strengthened webb's gold mirror to withstand the micrometeoroid strikes it will experience during its lifetime. so far, the telescope's primary mirror has absorbed 14 measurable micrometeoroid impacts, about 1-2 per month.

mike menzel, principal mission systems engineer at nasa goddard space flight center, said all but one impact were within the budget and expectations when they built webb. the anomalous event menzel was referring to occurred in late may and since it did not come from a known meteor shower, it was classified as an unavoidable coincidence.

&amp;#x200b;

https://preview.redd.it/319hmn0pe80a1.png?width=1100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bc7440c8d66e99e9ab38eab372a6e9a5f90b5752

still, it prompted nasa to assemble a team of experts to try to come up with a plan to protect webb's future. ultimately, the group decided that future observations would be planned away from what is now known as the micrometeoroid avoidance zone.

""a micrometeoroid hitting a mirror head-on has twice the relative velocity and four times the kinetic energy, so avoiding that direction when feasible will help,"" said lee feinberg, webb optical telescope element manager at nasa goddard. for decades of high-quality optical performance.""

it's worth noting that this doesn't mean webb will avoid certain areas entirely. instead, targets in the micrometeoroid avoidance zone will be imaged at different times of the year, when webb is at different points in its orbit. critical targets with limited observation opportunities, such as those in our own solar system, can still be imaged if desired.

today at **1:04 am est**, nasa will conduct the first launch of the most powerful rocket in the world, the sls, as part of the artemis i mission. the goal of today's test flight is to send the uncrewed orion capsule to the orbit of the moon. the rocket is also carrying along several small satellites designed for lunar and asteroid science. in around a month's time, the orion capsule will splash down in the pacific ocean and the mission will conclude.

this is the third launch attempt for artemis i, after the first and second attempts a few weeks ago encountered problems with fueling the rocket and the engines. nasa has devised a plan involving slower fueling of the rocket so that hopefully, we get a successful launch today. *third time's the charm!*

3088,1,"what if dark matter is just gravitational wrinkles?we imagine the space-time tissue to be, if you remove all the matter, flat, with no gravitational distortions. what if it isn't?

what if, for reasons unknown, the universe always had ""wrinkles"", which expanded with the universe? matter would eventually find itself inside one of these wrinkles, and then: galaxies. the center of the wrinkle is gonna be, even that slightly, stronger, so more matter aglomerates and know we have galactic black holes.

considering all that, there are two hypothesis: 

1. as the wrinkles expand with the universe, their gravitational strength remains constant

2. as the wrinkles expand, they become ""shallower"" and their gravitational strength decreases

the problem is detecting it: because earth would be relatively static inside one of these wrinkles (because we're on a galaxy), it would be almost impossible to detect dark matter, as either 1 is right and it's strength remains constant or 2 is right and the gravity only decreases as time passes, getting progressively harder to detect anything (i'll call all this f1 = factor 1)

i imagine that, if 2 is correct, we could prove this hypothesis by observing big galaxies: as the universe expands (ie time passes), galaxies would be seen losing periferic stars or slightly increasing in diamater (because the g strength gets distributed more evenly)

observing such large structures would serve as a way to prevent the effects of f1 not allowing to detect changes

just to add: i have zero math and physics credentials, i'm just an enthusiast, so probably someone already had the same idea i just had, or i've said something which is not correct",268,1685

if there is an end then another question comes to my mind why there is an end?  


it is said that our universe is expanding...expanding inside what?  
this particular question makes me think...are we real?...and also leads me to many other questions like reasoning our existence.",173,926

i'm assuming the amount of junk in space has grown significantly since '07, so how have we not yet seen a catastrophic accident? on a similar note, how will this impact space travel in the future? especially if we continue littering space in the same way we do with earth.",114,638

3145,1,"how to compute orbital decay of a cubesat?hello there space addicts:),

i'd like to compute the orbital decay of a cubesat in leo/vleo due to atmospheric drag. here is what i've done:

based on the **satellite orbital decay calculations** document coming from the australian government i managed to code a python script which computes the orbital decay of a satellite. the python script gives me the **exact same results** as in the paper.

however, when i compare it with the **cubesat drag calculation** study and do their sanity check, it does not work.

first i noticed that if i put the effective area ae in the script **i almost get the double of what i should**. i think it's linked to the cd coefficient that is set at 2 in the paper. but the script asks for the area which is ae/cd which double once more the result. i can't find why and that's really annoying.

then, running the script with 2\*ae as a, it gives me 3.32 years before applying correction coefficient and 4.28 after, instead of 3.16 and 4.04. it might sounds very close but it represents a 87,6 days difference which is a lot. the only value i changed is the 0.33333 from the original script to 1/3. so my 2nd question **is can anyone help me understand where does this difference come from?**

the last question is a**m i doing it right ? can i get accurate results for 3u cubesat using the atmospheric model presented in those papers?**

thanks a lot for your time and your help :)

3222,1,"[question] about infinity, matter and spaceduring a discussion i had with my six year old i realized that my understanding of these things may be much less solid than i thought. i basically said that space is infinite, but matter and energy aren't. so he naturally asked that if he flies into some direction fast enough, he would eventually leave the ""last stars"" behind him and end up with a ball of matter and energy behind him and nothing but empty space in front of him.

thinking about it, this seemed very wrong to me. of course, regarding photons, radio waves and so on, the universe's expansion is already happening at the speed of light, so you will never ""leave that stuff behind you"". but  factoring in cosmic inflation it is also impossibly to leave behind the universe's matter, right?  

also, according to general relativity, the presence of matter and energy affect space, so it would be even less impossible to ""escape"" from the gravity well of ""everything"".

i've gone even further with this in my head, as the philosophy of our night sky has been incredibly important to our early civilizations.   our night sky had a tremendous impact and influence on how we got to where we are today.    imagine civilizations coming into their respective ages with a sky dominated by a large galaxy such as the milky way.   how might that influence their societies?  their religions?

i've looked all over to see if any artists have ever created an impression of what that night sky might look like.  however, i have yet to find anything.    i think it would be an incredible sight.    anyhow, just something that i thought i'd put on here to see if anyone else ever had a thought on this.

3330,1,"spacex accelerates development of starship: salary increase encourages employees to move to the base 

according to news on november 12, spacex plans to conduct the first orbital flight test of the interstellar spacecraft by the end of this year. the company is making a major overhaul of management at starship in texas and plans to raise pay for employees who move to starship, people familiar with the matter said.

spacex president and chief operating officer gwynne shotwell (gwynne shotwell) and vice president mark juncosa (mark juncosa) are now personally responsible for the operation of starship base, people familiar with the matter said. the two are spacex's most powerful executives, aside from musk himself.

starship operations senior director shyamal patel, who has been working on the new spacecraft for more than two years, will be leaving the starship base for spacex's cape canaveral factory, people familiar with the matter said. .

spacex also quietly hired texas-based tesla operations chief omead afshar as vice president of starship production.

spacex is gradually building starship base outside brownsville, texas, as the main research and development, testing and launch center for the starship system. the starship system, designed to carry cargo and people to deep space, is critical to nasa 's plans to land astronauts on the moon. in 2021, spacex has won nearly $3 billion in contracts for the moon landing spacecraft from nasa.

shotwell and junkosa have been with the company since musk's early days at the helm. related personnel adjustments show that spacex is eager to advance the starship project.

a person familiar with the matter said that rong kesa visited the starship base this summer. he originally planned to learn about the project through a two-week inspection and report the progress of the research and development work at the base to musk and shotwell.

the person called junkosa's findings worrisome, finding that starship's first orbital launch took place later than company executives expected. spacex had hoped to have starship make its first orbital starship launch as early as the summer of 2021, but project schedule delays and regulatory approvals have pushed back the plan.

nasa said last month that spacex told starship that the first orbital launch could take place as early as early december.

in june of this year, the us federal aviation administration (faa) completed an environmental impact assessment of the starship base, which is also the key for spacex to obtain a starship launch permit from federal regulators. however, the faa has listed more than 75 environmental rectification measures for spacex, and it is unclear whether spacex has all rectification measures in place.

the starship itself, as well as the super heavy booster, are powered by spacex's raptor rocket engines, and the entire system is reusable. in contrast, the falcon series rockets are only partially reusable.

a year ago, musk described a ""crisis"" in the production of the raptor engine that resulted in a vice president in charge of the project being fired and leaving the company. spacex has since ramped up raptor engine production to seven a week. the increase in engine output is critical because each super heavy booster requires 33 raptor engines, and each starship has six raptor engines installed.

musk has also been encouraging spacex employees at its hawthorne, calif., headquarters to relocate to the starship base, and the company has recently pushed even harder.

last week, spacex unveiled a salary increase for fixed-salary employees that would see wage increases of 10% to 25% if they moved to work at the starship base in south texas, people familiar with the matter said. it is understood that the company has also increased the hourly wages of non-fixed salary employees working at the starship base, and plans to issue performance awards next year.

this year, spacex is launching falcon series rockets at an extremely high frequency and regularly performs cargo and crewed spacecraft missions for nasa and other agencies. but the research and development of starship is more important. spacex needs to use starship to deploy the second generation of starlink internet satellites, which is the key to spacex's further growth.

in addition, many customers are waiting for spacex to use starship to carry out private astronaut missions.

spacex's last flight test of starship was in may 2021, using a prototype sn15 that rose only to an altitude of 10 kilometers above the ground, a far cry from the altitude of an orbital launch. in recent months, spacex has conducted several consecutive static fire tests of the super heavy booster 7 and the sn24 starship prototype.",744,4737

by definition we can't observe what's beyond the cosmological horizon. so it seems we can't know how much energy and matter exists beyond it. yet it is only unobservable from our perspective here on earth. bodies nearer those masses beyond the horizon are being tugged outward by them.


could the mass beyond the horizon explain the accelerating expansion of the universe? could this actually *be* the dark matter which we literally cannot see but have been looking for?


can't the extra matter we term as dark matter (and accelerated expansion) be explained by whatever is beyond the horizon? and doesn't the sum of all observable matter plus this missing matter equal the total energy of the big bang? seems important because if true, dark matter will be forever unobservable and measurements of acceleration will be the only proof.¬†


p.s. i only recently learned about the cosmological horizon from a kurzgezagt video. so my understanding is limited. a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. but the above thoughts sprang to mind as result of that video. seems like the term 'observable universe' is used often... but i certainly never stopped to explore that term and infer that it implies there is an unobservable universe beyond.¬† doesn't seem like the unobservable universe is talked about much or hasn't entered the everyday world, perhaps only understood and thought about by cosmologists etc.¬†

secondly have we observed any other star systems with anything similar to the oort cloud?

thirdly how arent we able to prove it with absolute certanty that it exists when we can prove the asteroid belt and the kuiper belt that are much smaller(are they more concentrated/dense than the oort cloud?), or the thousands of stars and galaxies and blackholes that are immensly further away than the cloud?

mass (for some reason that we don‚Äôt know), slows down time. the more massive the object, the more time slows (relatively). satellites to massive objects slow down more on the side closer to the massive object, this causes them to turn towards the massive object. gravity is the product of objects of lesser mass turning towards objects of greater mass due to time slowing them down as a gradient, the closer atoms of the object being ‚Äòpulled‚Äô or ‚Äòslowed‚Äô at a faster rate than the atoms further away.",109,618

if the contents of a star, presumably made of hydrogen in enough quantities were consumed and accumulated to a high enough percentage in a black hole, would the pressure/temperature of said hydrogen within the black hole eventually be enough to ignite a fusion reaction?  could a new star be born this way from the stolen matter of an existing star?  would the black hole become a ""white hole"" if the fusion reactions prove luminescent and become a new type of star?",114,640

3527,1,"my fun theory.so i woke up this morning with this idea fresh in my mind for some reason.

so, anyways, to begin. black holes, immense gravity. discovery of white holes. now, we can only theorise about these white holes right now as they are so newley discovered. 

anyways, i believe that black holes bend space time so much, that they discharge the matter gathered, out of white holes in another part of the universe. thus being a wormhole in a sense. 

now, to switch over for a second. i believe that our universe is generated from a higher dimension. okay, its been theorised as well that these may exist. 

i believe, that when our universe drifts apart so much, and that there is such a massive void left in that area of space-time, that almost like overfilling a water balloon in a sense, that this higher dimension will basically burst into that void, because there is nothing there, matter or energy, to basically prevent it from happening. 

so everything drifts apart, and bam. basically a new big bang.

i also theorise that this means the universe goes on forever, no beginning and no end. because the process repeats itself eternally. and our specific universe goes on eternally. 

now i also believe that parallel universes also exist, as in, not in our specific space time, but as string theory states, in a membrane or waveform  or whatever, parallel to ours. 

i believe the only way to truly travel to another universe, outside of our space time, would be through supermassive black holes. i think that this would repeat in every parallel universe, and in every which way, because it might not even be just side to side, but side to side up and down in and out, whatever. 

now, so far we have not discovered any supermassive white holes, but i believe the implication of discovering them for ""normal"" sized black holes mean that they must also exist for supermassive galactic black holes. this is how we would travel to parallel dimensions, where we could theoretically find our counterparts, that however far away from our membrane would dictate how much different it is, not only for us personally, but potentially for pysichs as well.


now i understand this is a lot of theory and conjecture. but i feel it makes some degree of sense. 

and also that, there doesn't seem to be any size or indication of why a black hole would eventually reverse into a white hole and start spitting matter out randomly. i think this is evidence that they are discharges of black holes. 


basically why i label it a fun theory.

please let me know what you think. 

just a theory.",450,2587

secondly, australia is small, both in the space sector and its population. our small population means we due not have the taxes necessary to invest in space to the same level as larger countries. with more advanced research, comes diminishing returns for each dollar spent. if we consider research, what does australia expect to achieve that nasa cannot?

but my idea is more akin to have not the whole space station rotate, but only the habitat area. this way, the detrimental effects of zero-g on the human body would be reduced or ideally removed while still having access to areas of the station with zero-g or even different areas with different g force levels. this would open up many doors for new scientific experiments. growing plants in zero-g, 0.5g, 1.5g. you could have the habitation ring rotate to create a little over 1g to either mitigate negative effects or to study the human body under long-time high-g conditions. and so much more.

you could have several rotating rings to neutralize inertial forces on the station and you could encapsulate all rotating elements into a bigger structure to keep the vacuum away from the bearing or joint. like having a cube space station and halfways from the center to every corner, you have a rotating cylinder as the living quarters, while the whole or most of the cube is pressurized. i fail to see why people are so fast to discard the idea instead of facing the challenges. by the way, 'i'm not talking about these humongous rotating concepts from the 60s with clouds inside and entire landscapes. more like something in the ballpark of, dunno, 100 meter or a little more.

hello all.

i'm currently in the middle of planning the third book in my debut science fiction novel series. i'm running into some very hard science that i'd be so happy to be able to convey somewhat accurately, though i'm certainly no astrophysicist.

so, at the risk of embarrassing myself greatly, here‚Äôs the scenario:

europa is hurtling toward earth, and will impact with it in a matter of weeks. the source of fuel and thrust in the moon is a made up element called ‚Äúgalitite‚Äù which is a highly radioactive and volatile mineral found only around jupiter. the heavy radiation surrounding europa makes it impossible to enact even an unmanned mission to stop its trajectory to earth, so the government devises a way to change the earth‚Äôs orbit around the sun, specifically drawing it closer in.

the plan goes like this:

there is a special type of neutrino particle (made up of course) called the shn particle. this particular variant of neutrino is only found in sustainable quantities within jupiter‚Äôs thermosphere. many things about the shn particle are mysterious (thankfully) but the trait which is known to set the shn apart from all others is its variable mass, represented by the ‚Äúlemniscate coefficient‚Äù (made up lol). this coefficient allows the photonic mass of the shn to be altered instantaneously, and a shn particle has been recorded to fluctuate to a googolplexian gigatonnes in theorised photonic mass, though, that was only as high as instruments could measure (i still haven‚Äôt figured out what this photonic mass even is, so just ignore this if possible).

it is theorised that a single shn particle can fluctuate between both infinitesimal, and infinite mass instantaneously. though a shn is very similar to a photon in that it does not interact with normal matter, apart from the conveyance of wave oscillations, its endlessly fluctuating container was found to be able to store ordered data. once the written shn has been reintroduced into neutrino quaternary oscillation, the measureless ordering of neutrinos can become a very fast, and very powerful computer. and, despite not interacting with mass, the photonic energy does translate into a source of gravity.

now, back to the sun:

the idea is to convey a programmed shn particle into the sun‚Äôs core, and cause the particle to expand, and drastically add to the sun‚Äôs gravitational pull using the resulted energy. this, in turn, will yank the earth into a closer orbit, thus dodging the impending europan impact.

i‚Äôm 100% sure this sounds hare-brained, and i‚Äôm not going to fool myself into believing this could be an airtight theory, but all i really need are the glaring issues to be sizzled out, so i can ‚Äúhand wave‚Äù the rest.

i'm hoping there is a physicist, astrophysicist, or anyone with more knowledge around these sciences than me who could show me just how stupid i am. any and all advice is much appreciated.

thank you for your time.",489,2983

3865,1,"did supermassive black holes collapse directly out of giant clouds of gas? it could depend on magnetic fieldsroughly half a century ago, astronomers realized that the powerful radio source coming from the center of our galaxy (sagitarrius a*) was a ‚Äúmonster‚Äù black hole. since then, they have found that supermassive black holes (smbhs) reside at the center of most massive galaxies. this leads to what is known as active galactic nuclei (agn) or quasars, where the central region of a galaxy is so energetic that it outshines all of the stars in its galactic disk. in all that time, astronomers have puzzled over how these behemoths (which play a crucial role in galactic evolution) originated.

astronomers suspect that the seeds that formed smbhs were created from giant clouds of dust that collapsed without first becoming stars ‚Äì aka. direct collapse black holes (dcbhs). however, the role of magnetic fields in the formation of dcbhs has remained unclear since none of the previous studies have been able to simulate the full accretion periods. to investigate this, an international team of astronomers ran a series of 3d cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) simulations that accounted for dcbh formation and showed that magnetic fields grow with the accretion disks and stabilize them over time.

the research was led by muhammad a. latif, an assistant professor of physics at the college of science at united arab emirates university (uaeu). he was joined by associate professor dominik r. g. schleicher of the universidad de concepcion in chile and sadegh khochfar ‚Äì the personal chair of theoretical astrophysics at the university of edinburgh and the royal observatory. the paper that describes their findings recently appeared online and is currently being reviewed for publication in the astrophysical journal.

according to recent studies, early stars (population iii) were not the only source of primordial black holes. credit: nasa/wmap science team
as they indicate in their paper, dcbhs are high-mass black hole seeds (typically around 1 million solar masses) that existed in the early universe ‚Äì ca. 100 to 250 million years old. as the name suggests, dcbhs are formed directly from massive clouds of dust and gas (due to instabilities predicted by einstein‚Äôs theory of general relativity). this sets them apart from black holes that originated from the earliest supermassive stars (smss), also known as population iii stars. as dr. latif told universe today via email, astrophysicists have long suspected that these may be how smbhs formed in the early universe:

‚Äúdcbhs are about two orders of magnitude more massive (10^5 solar mass) than black holes from other scenarios, such as stellar mass black holes (about 100 solar mass) or black holes forming via stellar collisions (~1000 solar mass). this makes them leading candidates, particularly for the first smbhs observed within the first gyr after the big bang.‚Äù

the existence of smbhs was originally proposed to explain the existence of high-redshift primordial smbhs that existed within 1 billion years after the big bang. but as latif and his colleagues explain, there were inconsistencies between what astrophysicists theoretically predicted and what astronomers have observed. in particular, there‚Äôs the role that magnetic fields played in the accretion of material with primordial dust clouds, which eventually resulted in gravitational collapse and the formation of dcbhs.

‚Äúthe standard model of physics does not provide any constraints on the initial magnetic field strength, and some models predict small b-fields of the order of 10^-20 g,‚Äù said latif. ‚Äúthey are about many orders of magnitude smaller than observed fields (about 1g). therefore, the scientific community thought that their role might be only secondary.‚Äù

this view of the m87 supermassive black hole in polarized light highlights the signature of magnetic fields. (credit: eht collaboration)
this mystery has persisted because previous attempts to simulate the formation of dcbhs numerically have been limited in scope. previous simulations have lacked the computing power to simulate the accretion process‚Äôs full length, which is considered comparable to the expected lifetime of smss ‚Äì 1.6 million years. thanks to advances in supercomputing during the past decade, different research groups have conducted numerical simulations in the past decade that show that magnetic fields can be amplified within a short period.

similarly, there‚Äôs increasing evidence that magnetic fields were present roughly 13 billion years ago when dcbhs are expected to have formed. to address this mystery, latif and his colleagues conducted a series of 3d cosmological magneto-hydrodynamic (mhd) models that accounted for a lifetime of 1.6 million years:

‚Äúwe model accretion onto the central clump forming in our simulation, which is a proxy for a protostar. we evolve simulations for about 1.6 myr, comparable to the expected lifetime of smss, and calculate how much mass accumulates onto the clump, which tells us the accretion rate. previous works evolved simulation only for short time up to a kyr (1000 years) which is much shorter than the lifetime of smss (~2 million years). therefore, it is important to know whether accretion can be sustained for long enough, which we show that it is possible.‚Äù

their findings are consistent with previous research by latif and his colleagues (and other groups) that show how magnetic fields play a vital role in the formation of massive stars and black holes. these studies have shown how magnetic fields are amplified (increase in jean mass) by accreting disks of gas and dust. these fields are responsible for reducing fragmentation and stabilizing the disks, eventually allowing these disks to achieve the mass necessary (aka. jean mass) to experience gravitational collapse and form supermassive stars and black holes.

‚Äúsuch strong magnetic fields can even launch jets and outflows and also help in transporting angular momentum, which is considered an obstacle for forming stars,‚Äù explained latif. ‚Äútherefore, they will have important implications for the magnetization of interstellar and intergalactic mediums (similar to what we observe in the local universe) and shaping the formation of high redshift galaxies as well as the evolution of massive black holes.‚Äù

these findings also preview what future studies could reveal about magnetic fields and their role in the formation and evolution of early galaxies. in the coming decade and after, astronomers are expected to study the jets and outflows of the earliest black holes using powerful radio observatories like the square kilometer array (ska) and next-generation very large array (ng-vla) ‚Äì which are expected to become operational by 2027 and 2029 (respectively).

4057,1,"my strange thoughts on space and reality. my brain has been going at light speed with it for a couple of days now. i managed to put some stuff into notepad, let me know if you all think i'm crazy. here we go:

the expansion of space isn't an expansion into nothingness. it's a greatening distance between all matter over time. if you take one, and make 2, now there is space, because there has to be space between 2 things, or else it is only one thing. in order to have 2 things, there must have been first one thing.

but at what point does 1 thing turn into 2 things? what is the smallest thing that we can think of that is fundamentally different from something else? the atom? no. because just like there are different types of people, there are different types of atoms. we must go smaller, into the quantum mechanics and planck scale. that is the smallest size we can see (calculate) with our current understanding.

and when you get to the smallest discernable thing, there is only that one thing left. and so if there is only one thing, where did everything else come from? i think the one way to answer that, is to recognize what that one thing is. call it god, call it energy, call it the natural forces. the important thing is to realize that everything in existence had to first come from that one thing, which includes our consciousness, which is the same. your consciousness and mine are the same. if we had different consciousnesses, our realities would be different and we wouldn't be aware of each other.

so what are these different realities? imagine you want to travel to a distant galaxy. the closest galaxy it takes 25,000 years for the light to reach us. but if you were able to instantly travel 25,000 light years to the source of the galaxy light, what would be there? at a minimum, you will arrive to a place that is 25,000 earth years older than the current observation. to witness up close what you were seeing from the earth telescope, you would have to go 25,000 years into the past. different reality indeed.

but if everything comes originally from that one true source of energy, what are we seeing when we observe a galaxy known to be heading away from us (as measured by the red shift)? when we observe these galaxies moving away from us we are looking backward in time, so instead of looking at a separate galaxy, could we be looking at our own past? and for galaxies moving towards us (blue shift)? it still takes time for the light to reach us, so then could we be looking at a glimpse into our future?

4077,1,"the march of the supergiant star betelgeuse going towards its big explosion 

picking up the splendid article by the physicist and famous scientific journalist, ***""robert lea"",*** which he publishes on the ***""medium daily digest"" site***, in the images of betelgeuse a darkening is observed that, without a doubt, reveals the changing form that the earth is experiencing surface of the red supergiant star.

as is known, betelgeuse began to dim noticeably at the end of 2019, suffering a drop in its brightness around 36% of its normal output, which arouses the interest of astronomers and researchers from all over the world who want to learn what the light means. drop in brightness for the star.

as robert lea informs us: *""betelgeuse's irregular surface is made up of giant convective cells that move, shrink and swell. the star also beats, like a beating heart, periodically changing brightness. however, these periodic changes do not they are as extreme as the changes the star has recently undergone. these convection and pulsation changes in betelgeuse are called stellar activity*.""

*this comparative image shows how the star betelgeuse suffered an unprecedented fade throughout the year 2019 and how its apparent shape has changed.* *image credit: eso/m.* *montages et al.*

**about to explode?**

this dimming profile of betelgeuse is what has led many scientists to speculate that the star is about to go supernova, a fate that awaits all red supergiants.

as explained by miguel montarg√®s, an astronomer at ku leuven in belgium, at the moment, two scenarios are being worked on. the cooling of the surface is considered to be due to the exceptional wake activity that causes a large ejection of dust clouds. but to answer if the red supergiant would be about to explode, the answer is that anything can happen.

the best thing is to learn from this occasion that surely will not be unique. it is obvious that the knowledge we have about the red supergiant stars is still quite incomplete and that monitoring the evolution of betelgeuse will be interesting and will be an opportunity to learn a lot about it, during the years or centuries that the process lasts. although, it is an event that had already occurred but still the images of the supernova explosion had not reached earth.

for its part, we have another new image of betelguese taken by a team of astronomers led by pierre kervella of the paris observatory in france, using another of the vlt's instruments, the vlt imager and spectrometer for mid-infrared (visir).

this second image, also taken in december 2019, clearly shows light emitted from dust clouds around the red supergiant. pierre kervella explains that the wavelength of the image is similar to that detected by heat cameras. the dust clouds, which resemble flames in the visir image, form when the star deposits material in space.

*the image is an artist's impression of the supergiant star betelgeuse as it was imaged using different state-of-the-art techniques from eso's very large telescope, which allowed two independent teams of astronomers to obtain the sharpest views of the supergiant star betelgeuse.*

*these views show that the star has a huge column of gas almost as big as our solar system and a gigantic bubble boiling on its surface.* *these discoveries provide important clues to help explain how these mammoths shed material at such a tremendous rate.* *the scale in units of betelgeuse's radius is also provided, as well as a comparison with the solar system.*",569,3809

4080,1,"how do we know that the milky way is a spiral galaxy 

hello! this is a very good question. since we are inside our galaxy, and so far we haven't sent any spacecraft beyond our galaxy, how do we know its shape? well, we can take clues from other galaxies that we have observed.

the image (artist's rendering) below shows what a spiral galaxy looks like if you look at it edge-on.

https://preview.redd.it/g3ondt7am5y91.png?width=505&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5c826955278e55cbd78f1436b0ce438abb27493

you'll notice that the edge of the galaxy appears quite thin, with a bulge in the middle. if you visit (or are lucky enough to live in) an area with very low light at night, you'll see the edge of one of the milky way's arms that looks pretty much like this one. the image below is an actual hubble telescope image of the center of the milky way.

https://preview.redd.it/744cfhuam5y91.png?width=602&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=442e91b4a20904e642ebd489afac917dc62efc0e

towards the center of the image, you will see a huge bulge of hot gas and stars that forms the central bulge of our galaxy. by looking at various other galaxies of different shapes and sizes with data about our own galaxy, we can make a fairly well-informed guess about the shape of our galaxy. these other data include the way various objects within our galaxy are moving, the amount and color of dust and gas in our galaxy point to it being a spiral galaxy like our other close galactic neighbors.",230,1487

so why is dod keeping meteor trajectories secret from the public?

there is nothing for humanity on mars. the pitch is great; humanity reaching beyond earth to colonize a new planet, taking science and technology to new efforts. however, in my mind, this is all one very self-indulgent waste of resources. colonizing mars proposes no intrinsic value to humanity‚Äî beyond interesting experiments to run on martian soil, studying mars will not change the fact that humanity will, realistically, always be bound to our local cluster, limited by the universal speed limit and the incredible lack of anything interesting within a remotely feasible light year range.

colonizing mars would absolutely be an incredible feat for science. however, i feel as if humanity has many more pressing matters than what, in my mind, boils down to ‚Äúdoing something just because we want to see if we can.‚Äù you see these multi billionaires like musk and branson dishing out these massive budgets, and national governments proposing tens of billions of dollars of spending on even preliminary visits to mars. how, in the name of god, is this more important to humanity than spending that money on defeating global hunger and building better infrastructures for societies here on earth?",251,1526

4211,1,"the forgotten aether has been re-discovered through the femto camera the aether has been proven to exist with an experiment using a femto camera and you can look that up. the background temperature that the aether maintains may originate from nucleus heat from a nucleus to the universe. in fact the infinite aether is just fields of nucleus heat or gravity fields. the heat inside the nucleus is infinitely divisible into smaller/hotter/denser nuclei. the 'nucleus heat' doesn't flow like energy but is a dark continuous heat. life wouldn't survive long in the nucleus but in orbit around it where its cold and reactions in stars can take place from the increase in molecular movement.     
  a gravity field and nucleus heat are the same thing. nucleus heat creates a density on the aether, essentially the more aether heat you squeeze into an area the hotter that area is, so density is caused by the motionless heat of the nucleus. when two gravity fields touch, the density of one field squeezes on the density of the other and vice versa pulling the objects together.  


energy is just hot density on the aether expanding into colder areas. when energy enters the gravity field of the nucleus the free moving energy gets as far into the field until its heat/density equals that of the gravity field. this is a good place i think for the electron shell to exist.  


time dilation occurs when the force of gravity puts pressure on the nucleus of an atom in a large earth like gravity field. the nucleus of an atom in a gravity field will get hotter as its own gravity field is pushed back in on itself. when an object is moving through the universe the same effect happens to the nucleus because each time it moves into new cold space it's heat takes time to expand and gets pressured in on itself. because the universe is a single infinite background the heat of the nucleus doesn't lose energy when moving.  


movement of an object and heating up of the nucleus through time dilation wouldn't effect the small infinite because it is too hot at the next level of atom/universe's to be effected by the heat of the outside universe moving. coincidentally it is to small of a movement to have much of an effect on any outside universe that would be super cold.    
  a magnet is like a fan where two fans facing each other would push each other apart just as two north ends of a magnet do. the medium for the magnet is heat and it circulates heat through en enclosed system in a one way direction. the magnet doesn't heat up just like a fan doesn't heat up because of the air it circulates.",476,2595

okay so it's apparently hugely disappointing how the space is devoid of intelligent life and how we are currently the only known planet with life on it. 

i always thought our telescopes were mind bendingly good until i realized we only detected 5246 exoplanets (according to wikipedia).

i cannot however say how shocked i was when i realized how low this number is. the milky way alone is estimated to have 200-400 billion stars and there are estimated to be 2 trillion galaxies in the observable universe.. yet we mapped only ~5k planets.

excuse my ignorance but that doesn't appear to be lot, at all?

and if planets are not illuminated and they don't emit light like a star would, we really have no clue if any of those 5k planets we managed to see actually has life on them? what i mean is, it's entirely possible that we simply cannot detect life on these planets.
i am pretty sure we are not seeing hd pictures of those planets but rather pixels? even if there was life there we couldn't deduce that easily at all. at best we'd search for biomarkers but even that seems like a ridiculously complex task at these distances.

also, am i correct if i say that that's the exact reason we saw only 5k planets, because they don't emit light like a star would? 

also, trying to get a feel for a reference point.. how many stars did we for example map out of the 200-400billion in the milky way? is there a huge database/map which keeps the track of these stars as obviously there's a huge number of them.",288,1651

4603,0,"national ignition facility (nif) announces net positive energy fusion experimenttoday, the national ignition facility (nif) reported going energy positive in a fusion experiment for the first time.

the experiment was carried out just 8 days ago (on december 5th) and, as such, there is not yet a scientific publication. this means posts on this announcement violate  /r/science rules regarding peer reviewed research. however, the large number of removed posts on the subjected makes it obvious there is clearly a strong desire to talk about this result and it would be silly to not provide a place for that discussion to take place. as such, we have created this thread for all discussion regarding the nif result.

there are plenty of articles describing this breakthrough but a personal summary will follow:

[financial times](https://www.ft.com/content/4ff76541-ebdc-43ed-bf4e-4faa75fcf2f9)

[new scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2350921-nuclear-fusion-has-there-been-a-breakthrough-and-what-will-it-mean/)

[bbc news](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63950962)

and countless others, fusion is obviously a popular topic and so the result has generated a lot of media buzz.

so what they say (in extremely brief terms): nif is designed to use an extremely short pulse ir -&gt; uv laser which rapidly heats a secondary gold target called a hohlraum, this secondary target emits x-rays which are directed at the surface of a frozen hydrogen pellet containing fusion fuel. the x-rays compress and heat the pellet with conditions in the centre reaching the temperatures and densities required to fuse deuterium and tritium into helium, releasing energy.

nif had a very long period of incremental progress before last year they managed an increase in their previous record energy output of a sensational 2,500% taking them tantalisingly close to 2mj which is a significant milestone, todays announcement is regarding the next step forward in energy production.

on december 5th, nif conducted an experiment where 3.15 mj of energy was released compared to the incoming uv laser energy of 2.05 mj. nif is reporting this as the first ever energy positive fusion experiment.

the total energy required to fire the laser is close to 400mj but this still represents a significant step forward in the fusion program at nif. there are lots of other caveats to this announcement which should be saved for the comments.

please use this thread for all posts related to nif, if you have any questions about nif or fusion, i am sure there will be plenty of opportunity for good discussion within.",381,2615
